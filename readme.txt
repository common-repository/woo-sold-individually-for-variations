This plugin allows you to apply the ‚ÄúSold individually‚Äù WooCommerce product setting to the whole variable product (including its variations), thus not allowing the customer to buy more than one unit of the variable product, even if it‚Äôs a different variation. You can also set that a specific variation is ‚ÄúSold individually‚Äù.

== Description ==

= Option 1: Sell the whole variable product individually =

This plugin allows you to apply the ‚ÄúSold individually‚Äù WooCommerce product setting to the whole variable product (including its variations), thus not allowing the customer to buy more than one unit of the variable product, even if it‚Äôs a different variation.

Example: Your WooCommerce store has a wine that you sell in 2-pack or 6-pack boxes, and, let‚Äôs say, for logistical reasons you don‚Äôt want the customer to buy both in a single order. With this WooCommerce extension, the client can only pick one unit of one of the variations.

Inspired by [this GitHub thread](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/issues/19443).

= Option 2: Sell a variation individually =

You can also set that a specific variation is ‚ÄúSold individually‚Äù. In that scenario, the variable product should NOT be set as ‚ÄúSold individually‚Äù.

Example: Your WooCommerce store sells music, both as physical CDs and digital downloads. Each album is a product with variations, allowing the customer to either buy the physical CD (as many as he wants) or the audio download (sold individually).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This plugin allows adding another variation to the cart if it has meta. Is it possible to block this? =

The way we‚Äôre checking for the existence of another variation in the cart is the same WooCommerce uses to find a product, which does not consider the same product with a different meta to be the same product.

If you want to override this behavior and want to avoid another variation, with a different meta, to be allowed on the cart, return true to the `woo_sold_individually_for_variations_ignore_cart_meta` filter.

= Can I contribute with a translation? =

Sure. Go to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-sold-individually-for-variations) and help us out.
